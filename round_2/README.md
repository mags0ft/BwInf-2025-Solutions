# Solutions for the second round of the 43. Bundeswettbewerb Informatik 2025

This folder contains the solutions to the tasks of round 2 in the [43. Bundeswettbewerb Informatik](https://bwinf.de/bundeswettbewerb/43/).

You can find the solutions for tasks 1 and 2 in the `src` folder.

**IMPORTANT!** Even though the solutions for round two performed well and scored 100% (40 out of 40 points), they did not suffice to move into the final round. Due to the high number of participants, bonus points were needed to qualify for the final round, which were not achieved in the required manner by these solutions.
